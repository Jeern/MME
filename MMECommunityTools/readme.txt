WebDeploymentHelpers
-------------------------
First addition are the WebDeploymentHelpers from lionel.limozin@bewise.fr and sebastien.reynier@bewise.fr

These guys have made 3 menuitems for Adding a generated dll to the GAC, for Recycling IIS App pools, 
and for Attaching the Debugger to the IIS process.

All 3 menuitems are relevant if you have the IIS installed on your development machine, a common usecase for Sharepoint developers.
